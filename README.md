A Home Assistant Model Context Protocol Custom Component

See [mcp-server-home-assistant](https://github.com/allenporter/mcp-server-home-assistant)
for the implementation of the Model Context Protocol Server that talks to this
custom component.

This integration is being ported to Home Assistant Core in https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/134122 so that a custom component will no longer be required.

See [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) for overall context.
